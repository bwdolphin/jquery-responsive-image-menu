jQuery Responsive Menu Panel Plugin
====================================

This is a simple jQuery plugin I created for a game that needed a button panel that would dynamically resize elements to fit the panel depending on how many elements there were and how tall the container was.  I tried my best to keep the plugin code as generic as possible, but I'm sure there's probably some edge case stuff I'm missing.
